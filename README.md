# user-management-system
The rest api contains two types of user(users and manager). The User can register, login, update, delete and the manager also can CRUD operations in User. The manger should have users list. I have hash the password and JWT authentication . I have a write a middleware to authenticate users. The listing api have sorting functionality and search api for manager only.
